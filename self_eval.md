# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

-I struggled with the last problem on the hashes_2.rb file. I was able to have the code run correctly once, but for some reason it stopped working. I will take a break and look at it again soon.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
-It can be difficult to remember to take notes at the moment. It can be hard to know what is valuable information and what isn't. I'm sure that is what editing is for.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
-I first look over and see if I can immediately find any issues with the code. Sometimes I rely on comparing to previous exercises or examples. If I can't find an answer I use google.
